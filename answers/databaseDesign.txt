A collection named restaurantapp will have two tables: restaurants and reviews.
the restaurants table will have 4 attributes named as: id, name(restaurant name), address and details.
the reviews table will have 3 attributes named as : id, reviewText and restaurantId.

the format of these two tables would look like:

restaurants
id          integer,(primary key, not null, autoIncrement)
name        string,
address     string,
details     text

reviews
id          integer,(primary key, not null, autoIncrement)
reviewText  text,
restaurantId    integer,(foreign key)

SELECT `Restaurant`.`id`, `Restaurant`.`name`, `Reviews`.`id` AS `Reviews.id` FROM `Restaurants` AS `Restaurant` LEFT OUTER JOIN `Reviews` AS `Reviews` ON `Restaurant`.`id` = `Reviews`.`RestaurantId`;

i am using sequelize which returns reviews table id's as array and simply use array.length for getting totalReviews.
like: const restaurants = await Restaurant.findAll({
      attributes: ["id", "name"],
      include: {
        model: Review,
        attributes: ["id"],
      },
    });
    const adminData = restaurants.map((restaurant) => ({
      id: restaurant.id,
      name: restaurant.name,
      totalReviews: restaurant.Reviews.length,
    }));
